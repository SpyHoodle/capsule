# Gemini is amazing!

For my use case it's perfect - getting information across about myself or a blog is just so easy and simple with gemini. Having a small page and getting straight to the facts is amazing. I'm honestly just obssessed with the protocol and it's actually fun to go and find people's personal capsules and blogs and projects on here. On the web you never find anyone's personal site, it's just littered with ads and repetitve websites trying to sell you the same rebranded software.

Not to mention gemini is mainly used by anyone who's somewhat tech-savvy, so there's no absolute idiots on here or coorperations which host websites which people *think* they have individuality when they create a profile on it.
