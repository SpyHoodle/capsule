# Fuck HDMI.

There's nothing I hate more than the HDMI connector. DisplayPort beats it in 3 main areas.

## Bandwidth
HDMI is always the worse connector when it comes to bandwidth. Recently HDMI 2.1 was introduced, which is has more bandwidth than DisplayPort 1.4, however DisplayPort 2.0 was also introduced which absolutely destroys HDMI 2.1. The bandwidth is up to ~80Gbps with the ability to fucking power two 8K monitors at 120Hz with 4:4:4 colour. Obviously such a monitor is yet to exist, but this makes DisplayPort much more future proof. Regardless, a lot of monitors only allow better features with display port connected - my LG UltraGear only overclocks with DisplayPort at 180Hz, and through HDMI provides a significantly lower refresh rate of just 100Hz.

## Licensing
HDMI does not support the freedom and availability of technology. You have to pay a licence to add HDMI to your products. The concept of a licence is just shocking, it doesn't matter how much you have to pay - technology shouldn't be licensed or owned - standards like video connections should be available and free as in freedom. Choosing DisplayPort over HDMI means that you support free as in freedom technology and open standards for industry created by VESA.

## Extra features
* DisplayPort works great with Thunderbolt USB-C. It allows laptops to be charged, and power two monitors with a single fucking cable.
* DisplayPort locks into place when you plug it in. This makes sure it can't come loose or be tugged out by small movements or gravity if it's a heavy cable.

## In conclusion
The most annoying part is that HDMI has the advantage when it comes to consumers. Not many people understand the differences and since HDMI is available everywhere everyone just assumes it's a fine port. If a business makes a product and they want a single port, they'll choose HDMI as it's the most supported everywhere. And HDMI will keep making money off licences.
